=head1 NAME

waltz - Waltz command line interface

=head1 SYNOPSIS

waltz <command> [options...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Waltz is a static site generator and site prototyping tool. In many 
respects, it is like Hugo for static site generation, and resembles
Middleman for application prototyping. Unlike those tools, Waltz provides
an easy upgrade path to a full-blown application development framework. 

Waltz is built with L<Dancer2>, and bootstrapping a site built with 
Waltz promotes it to a bona fide Dancer2 application. From there, the
sky is the limit!

=head2 Documentation Index

Documentation on Waltz is split into several manpages. Below is a
complete outline on where to go for help.
